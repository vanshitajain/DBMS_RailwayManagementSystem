# DBMS_RailwayManagementSystem
This project is about creating a database about the Railway Management System. The railway management system facilitates the passengers to enquire about the trains available on the basis of source and destination, booking and cancellation of tickets, enquire about the status of the booked ticket, etc.Passengers can book their tickets for the train in which seats are available. For this, Passengers have to provide the desired train number and the date for which ticket is to be booked. Before booking a ticket for a passenger, the validity of train number and booking date is checked. Once the train number and booking date are validated, it is checked whether the seat is available. If yes, the ticket is booked with confirm status and corresponding ticket No is generated which is stored along with other details of the passenger. The ticket once booked can be cancelled at any time. For this, the passenger has to provide the ticket ID (the unique key). The ticket ID is searched and the corresponding record is deleted
